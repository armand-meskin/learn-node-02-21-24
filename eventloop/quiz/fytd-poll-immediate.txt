- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/immediate.js.
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

-First the IO operation will happen first followed by the callback and the printing of read data 
plus the setImmediate operation. After, the timout operation will run last.

-If timeout is changed to zero there is no change since
the immediate callback goes to the check phase which has
priorty over the timer phase.
