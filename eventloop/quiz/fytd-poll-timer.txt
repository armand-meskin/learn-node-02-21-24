- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

- It will read the text file before executing the passed callback function. Afterwards it will run the timout func

- Increasing the timout from 10 to 150 will not change the order of execution because the read file's callback is already happening at that time

- if we change the timeout to 0 ms when the async func is called the timeout of 0 ms would have likely passed by this time since it was declared first and is on the event loop.
Therefore it will change the order of execution and the timeout operation will happen before the file read and the sequential callback.
